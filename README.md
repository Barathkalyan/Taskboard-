# Taskboard-
Taskboard- is an original rework bringing forth the means to store agendas, tasks and lists as tedious and important as deadlines at your job or to-do lists as simple as lists for movies to watch or menial work at your house, using the interactive, user-friendly programming language of Python and the relational database management system provided by MySQL. The main purpose of Taskboard- is to get rid of the repetitive and underwhelming applications which lack the convenience to be more useful at all places and replace the aforementioned applications with better design and ease of access. It is better suited for a niche and is open source. 
Using Python’s inbuilt libraries filled with countless functions and modules along with the vast features provided by MySQL allowed us to accomplish this feat

The main objective of this project is to manage employee data and assign tasks for them. Our project has two components:
                                                     ADMIN MODE
                                                     EMPLOYEE MODE

The admin mode is accessible only if valid ID is entered. We have the following modules in Admin mode:
	Enrolment of New Employee
	To add Tasks to employees
	To update the Tasks
	Disenrollment of Employee
	To view the Status of Completion of Tasks

We have the following modules in Employee mode:
	To View the Assigned Tasks
	Confirmation of completion of Tasks

Future Upgradations:
Creating a UI and making it a full fledged web application with python as backend!
